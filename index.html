  <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h3>
  <p> Hello! My name is T&#252;lin Varol Mete and I have a PhD in high energy
  physics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. During the second half of my Ph.D. and my postdoctoral tenure (2011-2022),
  I was based at Geneva, Switzerland as a member of the <a href="https://atlas.cern/">ATLAS
  experiment</a> at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organisation for Nuclear
  Research (<a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a>).
  </br>
  </br>
  Officially, my job was to conduct data analyses to infer meaningful
  insights for new physics searches. It's actually a fancy way of
  saying to dredge up something interesting from the wreckage of two
  protons after they collide in a cavity that is as empty as interplanetary space and colder than outer space, literally in the coolest place in the universe!
  </br>
  </br>
  Working as a physicist at CERN, I gained a wide-range of valuable
  experiences, including working with peta-byte scale data, utilizing
  cloud computing platforms and machine learning techniques, developing problem solving skills and
  implementing various statistical methods. I also served as a run
  coordinator for the ATLAS detector's Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter
  operation team and also as an online data quality expert for Global
  Monitoring. Particularly in these roles, I enhanced my leadership
  skills and strategic decision-making in high-pressure and time-critical settings.
  </br>
  </br>
  In 2022, I relocated to the western suburbs of Chicago due to family
  circumstances, where I am currently based. During the time I have
  not been working, I developed a strong interest in quantum
  computation and have been actively learning through online
  platforms. My academic background is rooted in high-energy physics,
  and the idea of applying the principles that govern the subatomic
  world to computational systems deeply fascinates me. Recently, I’ve
  been exploring exciting opportunities that will challenge me and
  allow me to further develop my skills.
  </br>
  </br>
  If you are interested, you can find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn
  profiles on the navigation bar up top. Feel free to get in touch
  with me. I would be happy to meet unique minds, exchange ideas,
  share my experiences and learn from your experiences.
