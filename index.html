    <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h3>
    <p> Hello! My name is T&#252;lin (Varol) Mete and I have a PhD in high energy
    physics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. During the second half of my Ph.D. and my postdoctoral tenure,
    I was based at Geneva, Switzerland as a member of the <a href="https://atlas.cern/">ATLAS
    experiment</a> at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organisation for Nuclear
    Research (<a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a>).
    </br>
    </br>
    My job was to conduct data analyses to infer meaningful
    insights for new physics searches. Working as a physicist at CERN,
    I gained a wide-range of valuable experiences, including working
    with peta-byte scale data, utilizing cloud computing platforms and
    machine learning techniques, developing problem solving skills and
    implementing various statistical methods. I also contributed to the
    detector operations by serving as a run coordinator for the ATLAS
    detector's Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter operation team and also as
    an online data quality expert for Global Monitoring. Particularly in
    these roles, I enhanced my leadership skills and strategic
    decision-making in high-pressure and time-critical settings.
    </br>
    </br>
    A few years back, I relocated to the western suburbs of Chicago due to family
    circumstances, where I am currently based. Since then, I developed a
    strong interest in quantum computation and have been actively learning through online
    platforms. My academic background is rooted in high energy physics,
    and the idea of applying the principles that govern the subatomic
    world to computational systems deeply fascinates me. Recently, I’ve
    been exploring exciting opportunities that will challenge me and
    allow me to further develop my skills.
    </br>

    If you are interested, you can find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn
    profiles on the navigation bar up top. Feel free to get in touch
    with me. I would be happy to meet unique minds, exchange ideas,
    share my experiences and learn from your experiences.
